4. Where are the outliers and why should you care about them?
When parking spaces are in short supply, Hong Kong drivers need to spend more time looking for parking spaces on the road. This not only increases the number of vehicles on the road, but also increases the time vehicles are on the road, thereby exacerbating traffic congestion. After I make this report, it will be helpful to Hong Kong drivers.
